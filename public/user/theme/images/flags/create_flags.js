// This is just a placeholder. Please manually download or create flag icons for your languages
// Recommended approach:
// 1. Download flag icons from a free icon site like flaticon.com or icons8.com
// 2. Save them as en.png and vi.png in this directory
// 3. Make sure they're square (32x32 pixels would be good)
// 4. If you need to generate them programmatically, you could use a canvas-based approach

console.log("Please manually add flag icons for your languages.");
